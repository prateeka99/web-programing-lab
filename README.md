**SRMChat - A Web Based Chatting Portal**

On the Internet, chatting is talking to other people who are using the Internet at the same
time you are. Usually, this "talking" is the exchange of typed-in messages requiring one site
as the repository for the messages (or "chat site") and a group of users who take part from
anywhere on the Internet. In some cases, a private chat can be arranged between two parties
who meet initially in a group chat. Chats can be ongoing or scheduled for a particular time
and duration. Most chats are focused on a particular topic of interest and some involve
guest experts or famous people who "talk" to anyone joining the chat. (Transcripts of a chat
can be archived for later reference.).
SRM Chat is a web-based chatting system, written in php, for students to communicate
with their classmates on day to day college affairs.
